## EmojiStreamer ~ https://emoji-streamer.glitch.me

Real-time streaming of any emojis within comments posted to Reddit! A neat one-page app.

### How does it work?

Every comment posted to Reddit is scanned for emojis using PRAW (The Python Reddit API Wrapper). 

The 'scanner' is a Python child process of a Node.js app. Should an emoji be found, it's piped to the Node.js app. 

From there, emojis are sent to every connected WebSocket client (a.k.a. you!) üëç

### Travis CI / Testing

Test builds are ran for every commit to `master` at the moment.

Integration tests are used to ensure that the connection to Reddit is functional.

The setup steps are the same as the install stage but swap `npm start` for `npm test`.

See `.travis.yml` for more information.

### Install

Tested with `Python 3.7` and `Node v10` but earlier versions 'should' work - we don't use any bleeding edge features.

Set your Reddit API keys to enviroment values `CLIENTID` and `CLIENTSECRET`. Set your python alias to `PY` (e.g. 'python', 'python3').

`pip install -r requirements1.txt` (named differently to allow deploying to Glitch)

`npm install`

`npm start`

The page is then hosted on `localhost`, the port is `PORT` or `8080`.
